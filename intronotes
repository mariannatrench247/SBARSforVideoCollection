#The purpose of this program/model is to develop a series of datasets while overlaying skeletal frames, the models in question will be skeletal based action recognition. 
#A series of datasets will be taken (image and video data) and OpenPose will be used to configure the data with action points and skeletal frames over the humans
#This will aid reducing the amount of computation needed for action/vision recognition and anticipate future movements of figures in real time 3-D space through analysis of 
and comparison of redundant information.
